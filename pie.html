                 Everything else is too sweet, sour, or bland-tasting 
                 Pumpkin pie awful. It’s like super gross and slimy,
                  and has no pumpkin flavor whatsoever. Plus, apple pie
                   is the most normal thing anyone can get. If you make 
                   it homemade, it’s really warm and calming to the mouth.
                    Other than that, pie crust is the best part. It gives 
                    you a break from the fruity filling inside and releases 
                    this beautiful, glorious taste of crust. It’s very bready,
                     and so delicious. It’s definitely worth the calories.

                 It was pretty bad so I tend to stray away from the option of pie for dessert.
                  Still, apple pie is the BEST though.
