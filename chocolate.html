            <div class="col-1-3"><section><p>Fudge is one of those things that is so rich and creamy
                that you can barely eat more than 3 squares. These desserts come in varieties 
                of flavors and textures. For example, you can have almond fudge, caramel fudge,
                and more. They all add up to create a very nice, simple variety of flavors.
                This tends to be more on the expensive side since it’s a pretty uncommon thing 
                to sell around in basic stores. Yeah, there are store-bought fudge like at Walmart and Fry’s,
                but homemade fudge in family-owned shops literally makes the best fudge.</p></section>

            <section id="passing"><p>Fudge is very rich so I can’t eat much of it without getting 
                full very quickly. You can easily get stomach aches with this, so I wouldn’t 
                recommend eating much unless your stomach can handle it.
